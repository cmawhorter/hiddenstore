Abusing browser cache to create a hidden cross-domain local storage

This was a work in progress and doesn't really work right.  The problem is that as soon as you get a path stored in cache it's not possible to know whether or not you checked it before, or were using it to store data.

There are probably ways around this but who cares.  The usefulness of this is limited.
